# “Baking a Python Dictionary From Scratch”

We're going to create our own version of a dictionary data structure in Python.
 

 ## Abstract

"There's two kinds of people in the world: people who've mastered dictionaries and total goobers." - Raymond Hettinger <br>
Let's not be goobers together.

Is it possible to build a python dictionary without the dict keyword? We’ll dive under the hood to build a dictionary data structure and become familiar with some concepts that the geniuses behind python understood.

## About

This is a Jupyter Notebook for a demo that was presented to software engineering students at Kenzie Academy.


Uses a Python 3 Jupyter kernel.

## Running the Application

Open the Jupyter Notebook Collab link directly in your browser -- does not require any installation. 


Use shift + enter to run each code block and see its output. Learn the inner workings of a python dictionary and become a Grand Pythonista, or at least be slightly less of a goober.



### Credits:
- Piero Madar, Instructor at Kenzie Academy, for Consultation


### Built With:

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) --  an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
